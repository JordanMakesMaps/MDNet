# MDNet: Multi-Patch Dense Network
A Keras implmentation of the MDNet, published in the 2018 paper titled, ["Multi-Patch Dense Network for Coral Classification"](https://afrl.cse.sc.edu/afrl/publications/public_html/papers/ModasshirOceans2018.pdf). The network was originally designed for the purpose of coral reef patch-based image classification, and currently is the state-of-the-art for the Moorea Labeled Coral (MLC) dataset originally published by Beijbom et al. 2012.
