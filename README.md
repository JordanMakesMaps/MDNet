A Keras implmentation of the MDNet, published in the 2018 paper, " Multi-Patch Dense Network for Coral Classification". The network was originally designed for the purpose of coral reef patch-based image classification, and currently is the state-of-the-art for the Moorea Labeled Coral (MLC) dataset originally published by Beijbom et al. 2012.
